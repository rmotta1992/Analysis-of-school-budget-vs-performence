According the analysis of the data schools with a higher budget did not have higher student performance. Like wise schools with a larger student body also had poorer perfomacne comapred to smaller schools. This can be explained by larger schools likely having a higher student to teacher ratio. 

Another finding was the regardless of school students tended to have better reading grades than math grades. This shows oppurtunity for growth in all schools.
